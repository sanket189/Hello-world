# Hello-world
Just finding my way around GIT Hub

Just a traditional Hello world program. Thanks to all my masters who have created internet, made life of people simple & pushing the mankind to higher levels. 

Hat's off to ALL the heartful souls who created Free software movement & making many features accessible and affordable to many people. 

We grow as everyone around us grow. Sharing is caring. -  which I think are the soul mantras behind Open Source!
